Overview

This Jupyter Notebook is designed for the analysis and prediction of hotel reservations using the Hotel Booking Demand dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset contains anonymized information about bookings made by customers, including various attributes such as booking date, arrival date, number of adults/children, and booking channels. This README provides a brief overview of the notebook's contents and how to navigate through it.
